TEST PLAN:

   *If passengers seated on the car button sensor will be activated.

   *After passenger and driver seated, the user needs to enable the heater sensor.

   *Enabling both button and heater sensor, LED will be ON (binary output).

   *Enabling any one of sensor not both  any one of switche open  LED OFF LED OFF. 

   *Reads temperature information from temperature sensor and convert analong inputs to digital using ADC  Read ADC from temperature sensor  Successfully read and covert digital values.

   *Display CDD-CRO will give the temperature value by showing PWM and  Read ADC values  successfully displayed temperature.
  
  * Display digital temperature values in serial monitor using UART communication protocol Read ADC values successfully displayed temperature Requirement based.
